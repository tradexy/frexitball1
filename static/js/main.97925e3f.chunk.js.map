With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947. The Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world`s most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 and hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Final. The final matches for the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship, a FIFA World Cup final and a Copa Libertadores final. On 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to Santiago Bernabéu and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old Ramin Amin. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began. The Nuevo Estadio Chamartín (English: New Chamartín Stadium) was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the Portuguese side Os Belenenses, which resulted in a 3–1 victory for Los Blancos. The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans.

It has a seating capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy. On 3 March 1980, the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner (1934, 1938) who played for Inter and briefly for Milan in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The San Siro is a UEFA category four stadium. It hosted six games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and four European Cup finals, in 1965, 1970, 2001 and 2016. Construction of the stadium commenced in 1925 in the district of Milan named San Siro, with the new stadium originally named Nuovo Stadio Calcistico San Siro (San Siro New Football Stadium). The idea to build a stadium in the same district as the horse racing track belonged to the president of A.C. Milan at the time, Piero Pirelli. The architects designed a private stadium only for football, without athletics tracks which characterized Italian stadiums built with public funds. The inauguration was on 19 September 1926, when 35,000 spectators saw Inter defeat Milan 6–3. Originally, the ground was home and property of A.C. Milan. Finally, in 1947, Inter, who used to play in the Arena Civica downtown, became tenants and the two have shared the ground ever since. From 1948 to 1955, engineers Armando Ronca and Ferruccio Calzolari developed the project for the second extension of the stadium, which was meant to increase the capacity from 50,000 to 150,000 visitors. Calzolari and Ronca proposed three additional, vertically arranged, rings of spectator rows. Nineteen spiralling ramps – each 200 metres long – gave access to the upper tiers. During construction, the realisation of the highest of the three rings was abandoned and the number of visitors limited to 100,000. On 2 March 1980 the stadium was named for Giuseppe Meazza (1910–1979), one of the most famous Milanese footballers. Two Milan derby Champions League knockout ties have taken place at San Siro, in 2003 and 2005, with A.C. Milan winning both matches. The reaction of Inter`s fans to impending defeat in the latter match (throwing flares and other objects at Milan players and forcing the match to be abandoned) earned the club a large fine and a four-game ban on spectators attending European fixtures there the following season. Apart from being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team occasionally plays games there.

It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two UEFA Cup Winners` Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup final games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga final games, twenty-one Supercopa de España final games, five matches including the opening game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the football competition final at the 1992 Summer Olympics. The stadium`s capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0. Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line. Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993–94, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favor of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998–99 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou`s capacity settled to its current level. The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final later that year where Manchester United played Bayern Munich. United won 2–1, coming back from 0–1 down in injury time. During 1998–99, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities. In 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium`s name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.\",img_src: \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rpZ2K8Y3HYhJcGw4KLrz8g.jpeg\",profile_img: \"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/05/19/AbroadBarcelonaHKGPXD.jpg\",url: \"Camp-Nou\",},\r\n{name: \"Anfield\",description: \"Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, England, which has a seating capacity of 54,074, making it the sixth largest football stadium in England. It has been the home of Liverpool FC since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of Everton FC from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president. The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity. Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. A statue of Shankly is also outside the stadium. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen. Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014. This extension increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, making it one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football. There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium size to around 61,000.

The stadium was built on the site of Juventus` and Torino`s former home, the Stadio delle Alpi, and is one of only four club-owned football stadiums in Serie A, alongside Sassuolo`s Mapei Stadium, Udinese`s Stadio Friuli, and Atalanta B.C.‘s stadium. It was opened at the start of the 2011–12 season and has a capacity of just over 41,000 spectators. Juventus played the first match in the stadium on 8 September 2011 against the world`s oldest professional football club Notts County, on 8 September 2011 in a friendly which ended 1–1; Luca Toni scored the first goal. The first competitive match was against Parma three days later, where Stephan Lichtsteiner scored the stadium`s first competitive goal in the 16th minute. Juventus only lost three matches of their first 100 Italian top-flight league matches at the Juventus Stadium. Juventus` previous permanent home ground, the Stadio delle Alpi, was completed in 1990 to host matches for the 1990 World Cup. The club`s move from their previous ancestral home, the Stadio Comunale, to the Stadio delle Alpi was controversial. The new stadium was built at a great expense, was relatively less accessible, and had poor sightlines due to the athletics track. Despite Juventus being the best-supported team in Italy (with the highest television subscribers and away section attendances), attendance at the Stadio delle Alpi was dismal. Average attendance was only a third of the stadium`s 67,000 capacity. The club bought the stadium from the local council in 2002, a decision which was popular with fans. Then, Antonio Giraudo (CEO of the Club between 1994 and 2006) committed the project to the architect Gino Zavanella: the initial project already includes features that will be typical of the final version, such as nearly halving the oversized capacity of the Delle Alpi and the elimination of the athletics track. Juventus moved out of the unpopular stadium in 2006 and began plans to build a more intimate and atmospheric venue. During that period, they played their matches at the newly renovated Stadio Olimpico, which was also unpopular due to its low capacity. In November 2008, the club unveiled plans for a new 41,000-seater stadium on the site of the Stadio delle Alpi. The new stadium, built at a cost of €155 million, features modern executive boxes, among other new developments. The completion of Juventus Stadium made Juventus the only Serie A club to build and own their stadium at the time. Then-club chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli described the stadium as `a source of great pride`. The financing of the project was contributed by the advanced payment from Sportfive for €35 million, a loan of €50 million (later increased to €60 million) from Istituto per il Credito Sportivo, and a land sales to Nordiconad for €20.25 million.\",img_src: \"https://www.mymotherlode.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/30PNjo.jpg\",profile_img: \"https://globeevents.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/turin.jpg\",url: \"Allianz-Stadium\",},\r\n{name: \"Allianz Arena\",description: \"Allianz Arena is a football stadium in Munich, Bavaria, Germany with a 75,000 seating capacity.

FC Bayern Munich has played its home games at the Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005–06 season. The club had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50% share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for €11 million in April 2006. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025. However, in July 2017 the rental contract was terminated, making Bayern Munich the sole tenants of the stadium. The large financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years. However, this name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was referred to as FIFA WM-Stadion München (FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich). In UEFA club and Nations League matches, it is known as Fußball Arena München (Football Arena Munich), and it hosted the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final.

Nicknamed `The Theatre of Dreams` by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United`s home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City as a result of Second World War bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s, and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000.

Armando, the home stadium of Boca Juniors) or `La Bombonera de Nervión` due to the Nervión neighbourhood where the stadium is situated. This stadium contains a singular legend: the Spanish national team has never lost a game against an international team in this stadium. In European competition, Sevilla has lost only five times at home; to AZ in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup group stage, to CSKA Moscow in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, to Real Betis in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League , to Manchester City in the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League and to Bayern Munich in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League. In May 2018, the club announced launching an expansion project for the stadium that will eventually increase its seating capacity up to 47,000.\",img_src: \"https://st1.uvnimg.com/a2/0b/4a5a5fef4e729317f4a6f91f9c59/2019-01-23t194844z-1830009035-rc18c0725c60-rtrmadp-3-soccer-spain-sev-fcb.JPG\",profile_img: \"https://www.recordrentacar.com/images/landing/delegation/SVQ/alquiler-coches-sevilla.jpg\",url: \"Ramon-Sanchez-Pizjuan\",},\r\n{name: \"Stamford Bridge\",description: \"Stamford Bridge is a football stadium in Fulham, adjacent to the borough of Chelsea in South West London, commonly referred to as The Bridge. It is the home of Chelsea Football Club, which competes in the Premier League. The capacity is 41,631, making it the eighth largest stadium in the 2017–18 Premier League season. The club has plans to expand capacity to 63,000 by the 2023–2024 season. When expansion starts, Chelsea intend to play at Wembley Stadium until they return in 2024. Opened in 1877, the stadium was used by the London Athletic Club until 1905, when new owner Gus Mears founded Chelsea Football Club to occupy the ground; Chelsea have played their home games there ever since. It has undergone major changes over the years, most recently in the 1990s when it was renovated into a modern, all-seater stadium. Stamford Bridge has been a venue for England international matches, FA Cup Finals, FA Cup semi-finals and Charity Shield games. It has also hosted numerous other sports, such as cricket, rugby union, speedway, greyhound racing, baseball and American football. The stadium`s highest official attendance is 82,905, for a league match between Chelsea and Arsenal on 12 October 1935. `Stamford Bridge` is considered to be a derivative of `Samfordesbrigge` meaning `the bridge at the sandy ford`. 18th century maps show a `Stanford Creek` running along the route of what is now a railway line at the back of the East Stand as a tributary of the Thames. The upper reaches of this tributary have been known as Billingswell Ditch, Pools Creek and Counters Creek. In medieval times the Creek was known as Billingwell Dyche, derived from `Billing`s spring or stream`. It formed the boundary between the parishes of Kensington and Fulham. By the 18th century the creek had become known as Counter`s Creek which is the name it has retained since.\",img_src: \"https://s1.thcdn.com/productimg/1600/1600/11848517-8114610508648852.jpg\",profile_img: \"https://mr3.homeflow-assets.co.uk/files/photo/image/16087/9084/_x_/BAN190034_06.jpg\",url: \"Stamford-Bridge\",},\r\n{name: \"Vicarage Road\",description: \"Vicarage Road, a stadium in Watford, Hertfordshire, England, is the home of the football club Watford of the Premier League.

It has been the home of Watford since 1922, when the club moved from Cassio Road. The ground was officially opened by Col. Charles Healey of Benskins Brewery for the visit of Millwall on 30 August 1922. In addition to being Watford`s home since opening, the stadium was also home to Wealdstone F.C. between 1991 and 1993, and to rugby union side Saracens from 1997 until they moved to their new home at Allianz Park in February 2013. After purchasing the freehold of the stadium from Benskins in January 2002, Watford`s financial situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year. However, after a campaign entitled `Let`s Buy Back The Vic` with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner Elton John donating the entire proceeds of a concert held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004.

It is the home ground of German 2. Bundesliga club Hamburger SV. HSV actually have nothing to do with the origins of the stadium, even though they own the current arena. Before the club moved to the current site they played at Sportplatz at Rothenbaum. Bahrenfelder Stadion was the first stadium to be built on the site of the Volksparkstadion and the AOL Arena. It was inaugurated on 13 September 1925 with a match between FC Altona 93 and HSV. In front a crowd of 25,000, HSV lost 2–3. At the time the stadium was also known as Altonaer Stadion, however it was not the home ground of FC Altona 93 (it was Adolf-Jäger-Kampfbahn). Altona was a large club of Germany that has long been surpassed by HSV. After a long break the stadium was finally renovated. Between 1951 and 1953 the stadium was rebuilt. On 12 July the stadium was opened as Volksparkstadion (The People`s Park Stadium), named after its location at Altona Volkspark (People`s Park). Most of the building materials came from the ruins of Eimsbüttel, a district of Hamburg destroyed under Allied bombing. The new stadium could hold up to 75,000 and continued to be used for the various sporting events of the city. In 1963, when HSV qualified for the newly created Bundesliga, they moved into the Volksparkstadion, a stadium that was both larger and more modern than Rothenbaum. At this time, FC Altona missed out on the opportunity and has struggled ever since. HSV then began to see some success in the Bundesliga and managed to maintain their status for years to come. HSV won titles in 1979, 1982 and 1983. The stadium is a UEFA Elite stadium which makes it eligible it to host UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League finals. A large clock was added to the northwest corner in 2001 to commemorate HSV`s status as the only club to have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation. The clock marks the time, down to the second, since the league was founded on 24 August 1963. However, after Hamburg`s relegation to the 2nd tier, it has been updated to reflect HSV`s foundation. In 2001 AOL bought the naming rights to the Volksparkstadion for €15.3 million, retitling the ground as the AOL Arena. In March 2007 the HSH Nordbank bought the naming rights for €25 million, and the stadium was rebranded as the `HSH Nordbank Arena` in a six-year deal. From July 2010 the arena was called the Imtech Arena, after Imtech bought the naming rights. After Imtech`s sponsorship ended in June 2015, the stadium reverted to its original name of Volksparkstadion. Due to UEFA regulations, when the stadium had a sponsored name it was referred to as the Hamburg Arena for European matches.\",img_src: \"https://aviewfrommyseat.co.uk/photos/anonymous-20151226104940.jpg\",profile_img: \"https://www.cunard.com/content/dam/cunard/inventory-assets/ports/HAM/HAM.jpg.image.0.0.low.jpg\",url: \"Volksparkstadion\",},\r\n{name: \"The City Ground\",description: \"The City Ground is a football stadium in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Trent. It has been home to Nottingham Forest Football Club since 1898, and has 30,445 seats. The stadium was a venue when England hosted Euro 96, and is only three hundred yards away from Meadow Lane, home of Forest`s neighbouring club Notts County; the two grounds are the closest professional football stadiums in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. They are located on opposite sides of the River Trent. Nottingham Forest moved to their new ground on 3 September 1898 – 33 years after their formation and six years after election to the Football League. To raise the £3,000 required to finance the move the club asked members, supporters and businessmen to subscribe to `New Ground Scheme` bearer bonds which cost £5 each. Over £2,000 was raised this way. The new ground was called the City Ground. It was only a few hundred yards from the old Town Ground at the opposite end of Trent Bridge, which had been named after the Town Arms pub. Nottingham was granted its Charter as a City in 1897 and it was called the City Ground to commemorate this as the land on which it stands was at that time within the City boundary. In 1952 boundary changes resulted in the ground coming under the local council of West Bridgford rather than the City. Opposite the City Ground, still within the City boundaries, lies Meadow Lane, home of Notts County. The City Ground was wide open on three sides with no protection from the weather but the pitch was one of the finest in the country. This was due to the presence on the committee of J. W. Bardill, a nurseryman whose family firm still exists in Stapleford near Nottingham and whose company was given the task of preparing the pitch. In 1935, the club had the opportunity to buy the ground from Nottingham Corporation for £7,000 but they declined. On 12 October 1957, a new East Stand opened at the City Ground costing £40,000 and having benches to sit up to 2,500 fans. The visitors for the opening were Manchester United’s `Busby Babes`, just four months before eight of them died in the Munich air disaster. A new record attendance of 49,946 was set in October 1967 when Forest beat Manchester Utd 3-1 in a First Division fixture, five months after Forest had finished second to United in the league. On 11 September 1961, the floodlights at the ground were officially turned on for the first time as Forest faced Gillingham in the League Cup. The Main Stand was largely rebuilt in 1965 but on 24 August 1968 fire broke out during a First Division game against Leeds United. The stand was damaged by fire but thankfully, despite a crowd of 31,126, there were no injuries among the crowd. The fire started in the boiler room, just before half-time. The only reported injuries was to the television crew on the TV gantry who had to climb down from the gantry as the ladder was stored in the boiler house and the ladder was the only way up or down, the gantry was extended the length of the stand and now has access at both ends. As a result, Forest played six `home` matches at nearby Meadow Lane and did not win one of them. Sadly many of the club`s records, trophies, memorabilia etc. were lost in the fire. The stand was refurbished. In December 1967 the City Ground was host to an England U23 match against Italy.\",img_src: \"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/b0/b0/0db0b0a386a09f62d83839f39b7d19bd.jpg\",profile_img: \"https://thelawyer.imgix.net/content/uploads/2018/12/07164833/iStock-532163450.jpg\",url: \"The-City-Ground\",},\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n{name: \"Santiago Bernabeu\",description: \"The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium is a football stadium in Madrid, Spain. With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947. The Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world`s most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 and hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Final. The final matches for the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship, a FIFA World Cup final and a Copa Libertadores final. On 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to Santiago Bernabéu and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old Ramin Amin. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began. The Nuevo Estadio Chamartín (English: New Chamartín Stadium) was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the Portuguese side Os Belenenses, which resulted in a 3–1 victory for Los Blancos. The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans.

It has a seating capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy. On 3 March 1980, the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner (1934, 1938) who played for Inter and briefly for Milan in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The San Siro is a UEFA category four stadium. It hosted six games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and four European Cup finals, in 1965, 1970, 2001 and 2016. Construction of the stadium commenced in 1925 in the district of Milan named San Siro, with the new stadium originally named Nuovo Stadio Calcistico San Siro (San Siro New Football Stadium). The idea to build a stadium in the same district as the horse racing track belonged to the president of A.C. Milan at the time, Piero Pirelli. The architects designed a private stadium only for football, without athletics tracks which characterized Italian stadiums built with public funds. The inauguration was on 19 September 1926, when 35,000 spectators saw Inter defeat Milan 6–3. Originally, the ground was home and property of A.C. Milan. Finally, in 1947, Inter, who used to play in the Arena Civica downtown, became tenants and the two have shared the ground ever since. From 1948 to 1955, engineers Armando Ronca and Ferruccio Calzolari developed the project for the second extension of the stadium, which was meant to increase the capacity from 50,000 to 150,000 visitors. Calzolari and Ronca proposed three additional, vertically arranged, rings of spectator rows. Nineteen spiralling ramps – each 200 metres long – gave access to the upper tiers. During construction, the realisation of the highest of the three rings was abandoned and the number of visitors limited to 100,000. On 2 March 1980 the stadium was named for Giuseppe Meazza (1910–1979), one of the most famous Milanese footballers. Two Milan derby Champions League knockout ties have taken place at San Siro, in 2003 and 2005, with A.C. Milan winning both matches. The reaction of Inter`s fans to impending defeat in the latter match (throwing flares and other objects at Milan players and forcing the match to be abandoned) earned the club a large fine and a four-game ban on spectators attending European fixtures there the following season. Apart from being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team occasionally plays games there. It has also been used for the European Cup finals of 1965 (won by Inter), 1970 (won by Feyenoord), and the UEFA Champions League finals of 2001 (won by FC Bayern Munich) and 2016 (won by Real Madrid).\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11FfjaCPaSTryLu9KzstQFc2s-afyg7Lh\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1koo4dPWsweRnMMAMIAtVk8qKgDv8HCAH\",url: \"San-Siro\",},\r\n{name: \"Camp Nou\",description: \"Camp Nou, meaning new field, often referred to in English as the Nou Camp) is the home stadium of FC Barcelona since its completion in 1957.

It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two UEFA Cup Winners` Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup final games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga final games, twenty-one Supercopa de España final games, five matches including the opening game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the football competition final at the 1992 Summer Olympics. The stadium`s capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0. Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line. Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993–94, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favor of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998–99 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou`s capacity settled to its current level. The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final later that year where Manchester United played Bayern Munich. United won 2–1, coming back from 0–1 down in injury time. During 1998–99, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities. In 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium`s name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tj4tArodJq4QAzS11HtOKXmDEqML9jzt\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dOM4GlFk2kO7kZ6sfup0lDa98NbyOtur\",url: \"Camp-Nou\",},\r\n{name: \"Anfield\",description: \"Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, England, which has a seating capacity of 54,074, making it the sixth largest football stadium in England.

It was originally the home of Everton FC from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president. The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity. Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. A statue of Shankly is also outside the stadium. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen.

The stadium was built on the site of Juventus` and Torino`s former home, the Stadio delle Alpi, and is one of only four club-owned football stadiums in Serie A, alongside Sassuolo`s Mapei Stadium, Udinese`s Stadio Friuli, and Atalanta B.C.‘s stadium. It was opened at the start of the 2011–12 season and has a capacity of just over 41,000 spectators. Juventus played the first match in the stadium on 8 September 2011 against the world`s oldest professional football club Notts County, on 8 September 2011 in a friendly which ended 1–1; Luca Toni scored the first goal. The first competitive match was against Parma three days later, where Stephan Lichtsteiner scored the stadium`s first competitive goal in the 16th minute. Juventus only lost three matches of their first 100 Italian top-flight league matches at the Juventus Stadium. Juventus` previous permanent home ground, the Stadio delle Alpi, was completed in 1990 to host matches for the 1990 World Cup. The club`s move from their previous ancestral home, the Stadio Comunale, to the Stadio delle Alpi was controversial. The new stadium was built at a great expense, was relatively less accessible, and had poor sightlines due to the athletics track. Despite Juventus being the best-supported team in Italy (with the highest television subscribers and away section attendances), attendance at the Stadio delle Alpi was dismal. Average attendance was only a third of the stadium`s 67,000 capacity. The club bought the stadium from the local council in 2002, a decision which was popular with fans. Then, Antonio Giraudo (CEO of the Club between 1994 and 2006) committed the project to the architect Gino Zavanella: the initial project already includes features that will be typical of the final version, such as nearly halving the oversized capacity of the Delle Alpi and the elimination of the athletics track. Juventus moved out of the unpopular stadium in 2006 and began plans to build a more intimate and atmospheric venue. During that period, they played their matches at the newly renovated Stadio Olimpico, which was also unpopular due to its low capacity. In November 2008, the club unveiled plans for a new 41,000-seater stadium on the site of the Stadio delle Alpi. The new stadium, built at a cost of €155 million, features modern executive boxes, among other new developments. The completion of Juventus Stadium made Juventus the only Serie A club to build and own their stadium at the time. Then-club chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli described the stadium as `a source of great pride`. The financing of the project was contributed by the advanced payment from Sportfive for €35 million, a loan of €50 million (later increased to €60 million) from Istituto per il Credito Sportivo, and a land sales to Nordiconad for €20.25 million.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RMkp8_alE1TwuLAvOtvc1L8BBOxiXhiR\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yMOmXl4xC7gmsqEG4ohygOsfPb0q-Dtw\",url: \"Allianz-Stadium\",},\r\n{name: \"Allianz Arena\",description: \"Allianz Arena is a football stadium in Munich, Bavaria, Germany with a 75,000 seating capacity.

FC Bayern Munich has played its home games at the Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005–06 season. The club had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50% share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for €11 million in April 2006. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025. However, in July 2017 the rental contract was terminated, making Bayern Munich the sole tenants of the stadium. The large financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years.

It was one of the stadiums used during Euro 2000, and also held the 1998 Champions League and 2013 Europa League finals. The stadium will also host three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 of the Euro 2020. Both international and Dutch artists have given concerts in the stadium, including Coldplay, Take That, Celine Dion, Madonna, Michael Jackson, André Hazes, David Bowie, AC/DC, One Direction, The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé and Rihanna. The dance event Sensation was held in the stadium every year, up until the final edition in 2017. The stadium has a retractable roof combined with a grass surface. It has a capacity of 54,990 people during football matches, and of 68,000 people during concerts if a centre-stage setup is used (the stage in the middle of the pitch); for end-stage concerts, the capacity is 50,000, and for concerts for which the stage is located in the east side of the stadium, the capacity is 35,000. It held UEFA five-star stadium status, which was superseded by a new system of classification.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1aBuG0i8OTFVej3lw-VSuSgqm3UOFiVGo\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DBgX46dj-7UqsyRExXbXNd8VgEnjxiq2\",url: \"Johan-Cruyff_Arena\",},\r\n{name: \"Old Tratford\",description: \"Old Trafford is a football stadium in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United. With a capacity of 74,994, it is the largest club football stadium (and second largest football stadium overall after Wembley Stadium) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe. It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop. Nicknamed `The Theatre of Dreams` by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United`s home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City as a result of Second World War bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s, and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000. The stadium`s record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town. Old Trafford has hosted FA Cup semi-finals, England fixtures, matches at the 1966 World Cup and Euro 96 and the 2003 Champions League Final, as well as rugby league`s annual Super League Grand Final and the final of two Rugby League World Cups. It also hosted football matches at the 2012 Summer Olympics, including women`s international football for the first time in its history.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19nkQJCg1xMMhMeL60p1DSTKeRNWbxy3I\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1hHUOIzZDsc0b2T8-NmuNap7ZV6JF1VB0\",url: \"Old-Tratford\",},\r\n{name: \"Estadio do Dragao\",description: \"The Estádio do Dragão is an all-seater football stadium located in Porto, Portugal. It is the current home stadium of FC Porto with a capacity of 50,033, making it the third largest football stadium in Portugal. Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado, the infrastructure was constructed to replace Porto`s previous ground, the Estádio das Antas, along with becoming one of the host venues for the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament finals. The inauguration took place on 16 November 2003 with a friendly match against Barcelona, setting an attendance record of 52,000 spectators. A UEFA category four stadium, it has held several international club competition and national team matches, receiving some of the Euro 2004 matches, including the opening, as well as being selected to host the upcoming 2019 UEFA Nations League Final and 2020 UEFA Super Cup. Construction works began in late 2001, and were completed in November 2003, some months after what was expected, since in February 2002, Porto mayor Rui Rio changed the estate distribution, criticizing the plan for including high-scale housing and shopping for the area. These actions forced the chairman of FC Porto, Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, to halt all building operations, which were only resumed after a consensus was reached. Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado and built by Portuguese contractor Somague, it cost €97,755,318, of which €18,430,956 was subsidized by the government. To help underwrite costs, each stand carries one or two sponsor names: Super Bock (south), tmn (east), meo (west), and Coca-Cola (north stand). Away fans are placed in the right corner of the upper tier of the east stand, while home Ultra groups, Super Dragões and Colectivo Ultras 95, occupy the south stand and the north stand, respectively, like on the old stadium.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1z_dGP8puPR4EZxa3yaxuwjhSWO2-dn3Z\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19xaqrbA4KFoF2RPSJncG4Epx6U6rOhmS\",url: \"Estadio-do-Dragao\",},\r\n{name: \"Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan\",description: \"The Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium is a football stadium in Seville, Spain. It is the home stadium of Sevilla Fútbol Club, and is named after the club`s former president, Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, who served Sevilla for seventeen years in the early 20th century and helped pioneer the building of the ground. It was the venue for the 1986 European Cup Final between Steaua București and Barcelona and the 1982 World Cup semi-final game between Germany and France. Built in 1957 and originally an all-stand stadium for 70,000 spectators, its capacity was reduced to the current 43,883 when it was refurbished and transformed into an all-seated venue for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. It replaced the Estadio de Nervión. The stadium is nicknamed `La Bombonera`; more commonly used to refer to Estadio Alberto J. Armando, the home stadium of Boca Juniors) or `La Bombonera de Nervión` due to the Nervión neighbourhood where the stadium is situated. This stadium contains a singular legend: the Spanish national team has never lost a game against an international team in this stadium. In European competition, Sevilla has lost only five times at home; to AZ in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup group stage, to CSKA Moscow in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, to Real Betis in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League , to Manchester City in the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League and to Bayern Munich in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League. In May 2018, the club announced launching an expansion project for the stadium that will eventually increase its seating capacity up to 47,000.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1IAvkLJiDPS92u9exlCKnT3IfssasXQPw\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1NcZelHSisgopwc-6oJSdKn1-aqcNVv2B\",url: \"Ramon-Sanchez-Pizjuan\",},\r\n{name: \"Stamford Bridge\",description: \"Stamford Bridge is a football stadium in Fulham, adjacent to the borough of Chelsea in South West London, commonly referred to as The Bridge. It is the home of Chelsea Football Club, which competes in the Premier League. The capacity is 41,631, making it the eighth largest stadium in the 2017–18 Premier League season. The club has plans to expand capacity to 63,000 by the 2023–2024 season. When expansion starts, Chelsea intend to play at Wembley Stadium until they return in 2024. Opened in 1877, the stadium was used by the London Athletic Club until 1905, when new owner Gus Mears founded Chelsea Football Club to occupy the ground; Chelsea have played their home games there ever since. It has undergone major changes over the years, most recently in the 1990s when it was renovated into a modern, all-seater stadium. Stamford Bridge has been a venue for England international matches, FA Cup Finals, FA Cup semi-finals and Charity Shield games. It has also hosted numerous other sports, such as cricket, rugby union, speedway, greyhound racing, baseball and American football. The stadium`s highest official attendance is 82,905, for a league match between Chelsea and Arsenal on 12 October 1935. `Stamford Bridge` is considered to be a derivative of `Samfordesbrigge` meaning `the bridge at the sandy ford`. 18th century maps show a `Stanford Creek` running along the route of what is now a railway line at the back of the East Stand as a tributary of the Thames. The upper reaches of this tributary have been known as Billingswell Ditch, Pools Creek and Counters Creek. In medieval times the Creek was known as Billingwell Dyche, derived from `Billing`s spring or stream`. It formed the boundary between the parishes of Kensington and Fulham. By the 18th century the creek had become known as Counter`s Creek which is the name it has retained since.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1COnmmzcBzeA3PJlcjjX7Glmtm-CVGP98\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DswI22sQ9YQS6_5-KWCCiq8APf_wEwvg\",url: \"Stamford-Bridge\",},\r\n{name: \"Vicarage Road\",description: \"Vicarage Road, a stadium in Watford, Hertfordshire, England, is the home of the football club Watford of the Premier League. An all-seater stadium, its current capacity is 23,700 following the completion of the new Sir Elton John Stand in 2014, and expansion work in 2015 and again throughout 2016 and 2017; this included expansion of the football pitch. It has been the home of Watford since 1922, when the club moved from Cassio Road. The ground was officially opened by Col. Charles Healey of Benskins Brewery for the visit of Millwall on 30 August 1922. In addition to being Watford`s home since opening, the stadium was also home to Wealdstone F.C. between 1991 and 1993, and to rugby union side Saracens from 1997 until they moved to their new home at Allianz Park in February 2013. After purchasing the freehold of the stadium from Benskins in January 2002, Watford`s financial situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year. However, after a campaign entitled `Let`s Buy Back The Vic` with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner Elton John donating the entire proceeds of a concert held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004. On 1 September 2011 it hosted England under-21s 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 8 match against Azerbaijan under-21s.

It has a capacity of 62,062, making it one of the largest stadiums in the Premier League and the largest club stadium in London. It is designed to be a multi-purpose stadium and features the world's first dividing, retractable football pitch, which reveals a synthetic turf pitch underneath for NFL London Games, concerts and other events. The construction of the stadium was initiated as the centrepiece of the Northumberland Development Project, intended to be the catalyst for a 20-year regeneration plan for Tottenham. The project covers the site of the now demolished ground of White Hart Lane and areas adjacent to it. The project was first conceived in 2007 and announced in 2008, but the plan was revised several times, and the construction of the stadium, beset by disputes and delays, did not commence until 2015. The stadium was subsequently opened on 3 April 2019 with a ceremony before the first competitive Premier League game held at the stadium. The name -Tottenham Hotspur Stadium- is temporary, the intention being to sell the naming rights to the stadium, so that it will be named after a sponsor. The stadium is occasionally referred to as New White Hart Lane by fans and some in the media. The stadium is intended to be active all year round as a sports and entertainment destination with conference and banqueting facilities. It offers visitor attractions such as a Sky Walk, whereby visitors may walk up the side of the stadium, right up to the roof, and it has a viewing deck over the South Stand where they may view the goal line from the roof or abseil down to the south podium. The East Stand includes a double-height banquet hall that may be used for conference events. To the south of the stadium, the raised podium forms a large open public square that may be used for a range of sporting and community activities. The Tottenham Experience, which includes a club shop, club archive and museum on Tottenham High Road, serves as the arrivals hub for visitors, where they may collect tickets and start a tour of the stadium. The museum is located in the Grade II listed Warmington House, and the new club shop is the largest in Europe, featuring a 100-seat auditorium area that may be used for pre-match experiences. On the northwest corner is M cafe, a media room that may be open to the public and used as a cafe on non-match days. Other facilities may be offered in ancillary buildings surrounding the stadium, including a planned extreme sports building, a community health centre, and a ticket office.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qXX1zfVWac9UsLrzvw2Ift1J7DZEQWTS\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_ddlrZd7SREsjemLRQWq73oMGvyoT37L\",url: \"NDP\",},\r\n{name: \"Volksparkstadion\",description: \"Volksparkstadion is a football stadium located in Bahrenfeld, Hamburg, Germany. It is the home ground of German 2. Bundesliga club Hamburger SV. HSV actually have nothing to do with the origins of the stadium, even though they own the current arena. Before the club moved to the current site they played at Sportplatz at Rothenbaum. Bahrenfelder Stadion was the first stadium to be built on the site of the Volksparkstadion and the AOL Arena. It was inaugurated on 13 September 1925 with a match between FC Altona 93 and HSV. In front a crowd of 25,000, HSV lost 2–3. At the time the stadium was also known as Altonaer Stadion, however it was not the home ground of FC Altona 93 (it was Adolf-Jäger-Kampfbahn). Altona was a large club of Germany that has long been surpassed by HSV. After a long break the stadium was finally renovated. Between 1951 and 1953 the stadium was rebuilt. On 12 July the stadium was opened as Volksparkstadion (The People`s Park Stadium), named after its location at Altona Volkspark (People`s Park). Most of the building materials came from the ruins of Eimsbüttel, a district of Hamburg destroyed under Allied bombing. The new stadium could hold up to 75,000 and continued to be used for the various sporting events of the city. In 1963, when HSV qualified for the newly created Bundesliga, they moved into the Volksparkstadion, a stadium that was both larger and more modern than Rothenbaum. At this time, FC Altona missed out on the opportunity and has struggled ever since. HSV then began to see some success in the Bundesliga and managed to maintain their status for years to come. HSV won titles in 1979, 1982 and 1983. The stadium is a UEFA Elite stadium which makes it eligible it to host UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League finals. A large clock was added to the northwest corner in 2001 to commemorate HSV`s status as the only club to have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation. The clock marks the time, down to the second, since the league was founded on 24 August 1963. However, after Hamburg`s relegation to the 2nd tier, it has been updated to reflect HSV`s foundation. In 2001 AOL bought the naming rights to the Volksparkstadion for €15.3 million, retitling the ground as the AOL Arena. In March 2007 the HSH Nordbank bought the naming rights for €25 million, and the stadium was rebranded as the `HSH Nordbank Arena` in a six-year deal. From July 2010 the arena was called the Imtech Arena, after Imtech bought the naming rights. After Imtech`s sponsorship ended in June 2015, the stadium reverted to its original name of Volksparkstadion. Due to UEFA regulations, when the stadium had a sponsored name it was referred to as the Hamburg Arena for European matches.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1siS6lJtlFLgGlIQYd3TGPdPMXrDCgbjz\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1p_voIjiBizYQCC1F-bOcKzhos417qUjg\",url: \"Volksparkstadion\",},\r\n{name: \"The City Ground\",description: \"The City Ground is a football stadium in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Trent. It has been home to Nottingham Forest Football Club since 1898, and has 30,445 seats. The stadium was a venue when England hosted Euro 96, and is only three hundred yards away from Meadow Lane, home of Forest`s neighbouring club Notts County; the two grounds are the closest professional football stadiums in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. They are located on opposite sides of the River Trent. Nottingham Forest moved to their new ground on 3 September 1898 – 33 years after their formation and six years after election to the Football League. To raise the £3,000 required to finance the move the club asked members, supporters and businessmen to subscribe to `New Ground Scheme` bearer bonds which cost £5 each. Over £2,000 was raised this way. The new ground was called the City Ground. It was only a few hundred yards from the old Town Ground at the opposite end of Trent Bridge, which had been named after the Town Arms pub. Nottingham was granted its Charter as a City in 1897 and it was called the City Ground to commemorate this as the land on which it stands was at that time within the City boundary. In 1952 boundary changes resulted in the ground coming under the local council of West Bridgford rather than the City. Opposite the City Ground, still within the City boundaries, lies Meadow Lane, home of Notts County. The City Ground was wide open on three sides with no protection from the weather but the pitch was one of the finest in the country. This was due to the presence on the committee of J. W. Bardill, a nurseryman whose family firm still exists in Stapleford near Nottingham and whose company was given the task of preparing the pitch. In 1935, the club had the opportunity to buy the ground from Nottingham Corporation for £7,000 but they declined. On 12 October 1957, a new East Stand opened at the City Ground costing £40,000 and having benches to sit up to 2,500 fans. The visitors for the opening were Manchester United’s `Busby Babes`, just four months before eight of them died in the Munich air disaster. A new record attendance of 49,946 was set in October 1967 when Forest beat Manchester Utd 3-1 in a First Division fixture, five months after Forest had finished second to United in the league. On 11 September 1961, the floodlights at the ground were officially turned on for the first time as Forest faced Gillingham in the League Cup. The Main Stand was largely rebuilt in 1965 but on 24 August 1968 fire broke out during a First Division game against Leeds United. The stand was damaged by fire but thankfully, despite a crowd of 31,126, there were no injuries among the crowd. The fire started in the boiler room, just before half-time. The only reported injuries was to the television crew on the TV gantry who had to climb down from the gantry as the ladder was stored in the boiler house and the ladder was the only way up or down, the gantry was extended the length of the stand and now has access at both ends. As a result, Forest played six `home` matches at nearby Meadow Lane and did not win one of them. Sadly many of the club`s records, trophies, memorabilia etc. were lost in the fire. The stand was refurbished. In December 1967 the City Ground was host to an England U23 match against Italy.\",img_src: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1YjNSu_7wPpRdhtlhif70i54ja3ebpMc-\",profile_img: \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=19Ewn7gCoNdv4pvIv6QyaWErgGFjYd3x4\",url: \"The-City-Ground\",},\r\n\r\n\r\n];\r\n    ","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst Ccc = (props) => {\r\n    return (\r\n      \r\n            <div className=\"main-content\">\r\n                <div><Link className=\"back\" to=\"/cccs\">BACK</Link></div>\r\n                <h2>{props.id}</h2>\r\n                <div className=\"container\">\r\n                    <div className=\"ccc-profile-image\" style={{ backgroundImage: \"url(\" + props.image + \")\" }}></div>\r\n                    <h2>{props.name}</h2>\r\n                    <p>{props.details}</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        \r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Ccc;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {CccList} from '../data/cccs';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst Cccs = (props) => {\r\n    let cccs = CccList.map((ccc) => {\r\n      return (\r\n        <div className=\"Ccc-container\">\r\n          <Link to={`/cccs/${ccc.url}`}><div className=\"ccc-image\" style={{ backgroundImage: \"url(\" + ccc.img_src + \")\" }}></div></Link>\r\n          <h3>{ccc.name}</h3>\r\n        </div>\r\n      );\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"main-content\">\r\n        <div><Link className=\"back\" to=\"/\">BACK</Link></div>\r\n        <h2>{props.title}</h2>\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n          {cccs}\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Cccs;\r\n          ","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {CccList} from '../data/cccs';\r\nimport Ccc from './ccc';\r\nimport Cccs from './cccs';\r\nimport { Route} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst CccsContainer = (props) => {\r\n    let cccUrl = CccList.map((ccc,i) => {\r\n        return (\r\n          <Route key={i} path={`/cccs/${ccc.url}`} render={() => <Ccc name={ccc.name} image={ccc.profile_img} details={ccc.description}/>} />\r\n        );\r\n      });\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <React.Fragment>\r\n          <Route exact path=\"/cccs\" render={() => <Cccs title=\"Cities and Stadia\"/>} />\r\n          {cccUrl}\r\n          {/* <Route path=\"/cccs/hello\" render={() => <Ccc />} /> */}\r\n        </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CccsContainer;","//always need to have the below line for react\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n//below is to enable using different tabs - with react-router-dom download ----\nimport {BrowserRouter, Route} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport './css/style.css';\n\nimport Navbar from './components/navbar';\nimport Home from './components/home';\nimport AaasContainer from './components/aaasContainer';\nimport BbbsContainer from './components/bbbsContainer';\nimport CccsContainer from './components/cccsContainer';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n    \n    render() {\n        return (\n            <BrowserRouter>\n                <div className=\"App\">\n                    <Navbar />\n                    <Route exact path=\"/\" render={() => <Home title=\"Premier League 2019: Top Players\" />} />\n                    <Route path=\"/aaas/\" render={() => <AaasContainer title=\"United Kingdom\" />} />\n                    <Route path=\"/bbbs/\" render={() => <BbbsContainer title=\"European Union\" />} />\n                    <Route path=\"/cccs/\" render={() => <CccsContainer title=\"Cities and Stadia\" />} />\n                </div>\n            </BrowserRouter>\n        );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
