Patr\xedcio was included in Bento's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup as first-choice, and made his debut in the competition in the first encounter against Germany, which ended with a 0\u20134 loss. He missed the second game against the United States, due to injury. Patr\xedcio appeared in his 50th international on 30 June 2016, during Euro 2016: after the 1\u20131 draw to Poland at the Stade V\xe9lodrome during the first 120 minutes, he saved Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski's attempt in a 5\u20133 penalty shootout win that qualified to the semi-finals.

With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947. The Santiago Bernab\xe9u is one of the world`s most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 and hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Final. The final matches for the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernab\xe9u, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship, a FIFA World Cup final and a Copa Libertadores final. On 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to Santiago Bernab\xe9u and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old Ramin Amin. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Mu\xf1oz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began. The Nuevo Estadio Chamart\xedn (English: New Chamart\xedn Stadium) was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the Portuguese side Os Belenenses, which resulted in a 3\u20131 victory for Los Blancos.

It has a seating capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy. On 3 March 1980, the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner (1934, 1938) who played for Inter and briefly for Milan in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The San Siro is a UEFA category four stadium. It hosted six games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and four European Cup finals, in 1965, 1970, 2001 and 2016. Construction of the stadium commenced in 1925 in the district of Milan named San Siro, with the new stadium originally named Nuovo Stadio Calcistico San Siro (San Siro New Football Stadium). The idea to build a stadium in the same district as the horse racing track belonged to the president of A.C. Milan at the time, Piero Pirelli. The architects designed a private stadium only for football, without athletics tracks which characterized Italian stadiums built with public funds. The inauguration was on 19 September 1926, when 35,000 spectators saw Inter defeat Milan 6\u20133. Originally, the ground was home and property of A.C. Milan. Finally, in 1947, Inter, who used to play in the Arena Civica downtown, became tenants and the two have shared the ground ever since. From 1948 to 1955, engineers Armando Ronca and Ferruccio Calzolari developed the project for the second extension of the stadium, which was meant to increase the capacity from 50,000 to 150,000 visitors. Calzolari and Ronca proposed three additional, vertically arranged, rings of spectator rows. Nineteen spiralling ramps \u2013 each 200 metres long \u2013 gave access to the upper tiers. During construction, the realisation of the highest of the three rings was abandoned and the number of visitors limited to 100,000. On 2 March 1980 the stadium was named for Giuseppe Meazza (1910\u20131979), one of the most famous Milanese footballers. Two Milan derby Champions League knockout ties have taken place at San Siro, in 2003 and 2005, with A.C. Milan winning both matches. The reaction of Inter`s fans to impending defeat in the latter match (throwing flares and other objects at Milan players and forcing the match to be abandoned) earned the club a large fine and a four-game ban on spectators attending European fixtures there the following season. Apart from being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team occasionally plays games there. It has also been used for the European Cup finals of 1965 (won by Inter), 1970 (won by Feyenoord), and the UEFA Champions League finals of 2001 (won by FC Bayern Munich) and 2016 (won by Real Madrid).",img_src:"https://media.timeout.com/images/105121340/image.jpg",profile_img:"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Europe/Italy/Milan/milan-cathedral-italy.jpg",url:"San-Siro"},{name:"Camp Nou",description:"Camp Nou, meaning new field, often referred to in English as the Nou Camp) is the home stadium of FC Barcelona since its completion in 1957.

It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two UEFA Cup Winners` Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup final games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga final games, twenty-one Supercopa de Espa\xf1a final games, five matches including the opening game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the football competition final at the 1992 Summer Olympics. The stadium`s capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua Bucure\u0219ti was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4\u20130. Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line. Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993\u201394, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favor of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998\u201399 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou`s capacity settled to its current level. The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final later that year where Manchester United played Bayern Munich. United won 2\u20131, coming back from 0\u20131 down in injury time. During 1998\u201399, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities. In 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium`s name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.",img_src:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rpZ2K8Y3HYhJcGw4KLrz8g.jpeg",profile_img:"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/05/19/AbroadBarcelonaHKGPXD.jpg",url:"Camp-Nou"},{name:"Anfield",description:"Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, England, which has a seating capacity of 54,074, making it the sixth largest football stadium in England.

The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity. Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. A statue of Shankly is also outside the stadium. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen. Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014. This extension increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, making it one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football.

The stadium was built on the site of Juventus` and Torino`s former home, the Stadio delle Alpi, and is one of only four club-owned football stadiums in Serie A, alongside Sassuolo`s Mapei Stadium, Udinese`s Stadio Friuli, and Atalanta B.C.\u2018s stadium. It was opened at the start of the 2011\u201312 season and has a capacity of just over 41,000 spectators. Juventus played the first match in the stadium on 8 September 2011 against the world`s oldest professional football club Notts County, on 8 September 2011 in a friendly which ended 1\u20131; Luca Toni scored the first goal. The first competitive match was against Parma three days later, where Stephan Lichtsteiner scored the stadium`s first competitive goal in the 16th minute. Juventus only lost three matches of their first 100 Italian top-flight league matches at the Juventus Stadium. Juventus` previous permanent home ground, the Stadio delle Alpi, was completed in 1990 to host matches for the 1990 World Cup. The club`s move from their previous ancestral home, the Stadio Comunale, to the Stadio delle Alpi was controversial. The new stadium was built at a great expense, was relatively less accessible, and had poor sightlines due to the athletics track. Despite Juventus being the best-supported team in Italy (with the highest television subscribers and away section attendances), attendance at the Stadio delle Alpi was dismal. Average attendance was only a third of the stadium`s 67,000 capacity. The club bought the stadium from the local council in 2002, a decision which was popular with fans. Then, Antonio Giraudo (CEO of the Club between 1994 and 2006) committed the project to the architect Gino Zavanella: the initial project already includes features that will be typical of the final version, such as nearly halving the oversized capacity of the Delle Alpi and the elimination of the athletics track. Juventus moved out of the unpopular stadium in 2006 and began plans to build a more intimate and atmospheric venue. During that period, they played their matches at the newly renovated Stadio Olimpico, which was also unpopular due to its low capacity. In November 2008, the club unveiled plans for a new 41,000-seater stadium on the site of the Stadio delle Alpi. The new stadium, built at a cost of \u20ac155 million, features modern executive boxes, among other new developments. The completion of Juventus Stadium made Juventus the only Serie A club to build and own their stadium at the time. Then-club chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli described the stadium as `a source of great pride`. The financing of the project was contributed by the advanced payment from Sportfive for \u20ac35 million, a loan of \u20ac50 million (later increased to \u20ac60 million) from Istituto per il Credito Sportivo, and a land sales to Nordiconad for \u20ac20.25 million.",img_src:"https://www.mymotherlode.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/30PNjo.jpg",profile_img:"https://globeevents.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/turin.jpg",url:"Allianz-Stadium"},{name:"Allianz Arena",description:"Allianz Arena is a football stadium in Munich, Bavaria, Germany with a 75,000 seating capacity.

The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025. However, in July 2017 the rental contract was terminated, making Bayern Munich the sole tenants of the stadium. The large financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years.

After purchasing the freehold of the stadium from Benskins in January 2002, Watford`s financial situation forced them to sell and lease back the stadium later that year. However, after a campaign entitled `Let`s Buy Back The Vic` with donations coming from fans, as well as celebrity former owner Elton John donating the entire proceeds of a concert held at the venue, the club was able to repurchase the stadium in September 2004. On 1 September 2011 it hosted England under-21s 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 8 match against Azerbaijan under-21s. The hosts thrashed the visitors 6 \u2013 0 with braces from Craig Dawson and Henri Lansbury and single goals from Jordan Henderson and Martyn Waghorn. There were 7,738 in attendance.",img_src:"https://aviewfrommyseat.co.uk/photos/anonymous-20151104133743.jpg",profile_img:"https://i2.wp.com/newtowatford.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/dsc_0276.jpg?fit=3920%2C2204&ssl=1",url:"Vicarage-Road"},{name:"NDP",description:"The Northumberland Development Project is a mixed-use development project that centres on the building of the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to replace White Hart Lane as the home ground of Tottenham Hotspur. The stadium has a planned capacity for 62,062 spectators, and is designed to host football as well as NFL games. The development plans also include 585 new homes, a 180-room hotel, a local community health centre, the `Tottenham Experience` \u2013 a Spurs museum and club shop - an extreme sports facility, as well as the Lilywhite House, which contains a Sainsbury`s supermarket, a sixth form college and the club`s headquarters. Plans for the project were first announced in 2008 and a planning application submitted in 2009. The project however was revised several times and delayed due to objections by conservation groups and a protracted dispute over a compulsory purchase order (CPO) on existing businesses at the proposed development site. A revised plan was first approved in 2010 by the Haringey Council, and following further revisions, building started in September 2012. Only part of this initial plan was executed, and the construction of the stadium did not commence until 2016 after the CPO dispute has been resolved and a new design approved by Haringey Council. The anticipated stadium opening date has also been revised several times and the stadium is currently scheduled to open during the 2018\u201319 season.",img_src:"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c43389417f433da9cde5604c38fc4e6f8940de2/0_79_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d2672c3bd63068a9f5af3ac560fdf81d",profile_img:"https://hirespace.imgix.net/spaces/549/dglwiak4oeq.JPG?h=1080&w=1920&auto=format&fit=crop&q=40",url:"NDP"},{name:"Volksparkstadion",description:"Volksparkstadion is a football stadium located in Bahrenfeld, Hamburg, Germany. It is the home ground of German 2. Bundesliga club Hamburger SV. HSV actually have nothing to do with the origins of the stadium, even though they own the current arena. Before the club moved to the current site they played at Sportplatz at Rothenbaum. Bahrenfelder Stadion was the first stadium to be built on the site of the Volksparkstadion and the AOL Arena. It was inaugurated on 13 September 1925 with a match between FC Altona 93 and HSV. In front a crowd of 25,000, HSV lost 2\u20133. At the time the stadium was also known as Altonaer Stadion, however it was not the home ground of FC Altona 93 (it was Adolf-J\xe4ger-Kampfbahn). Altona was a large club of Germany that has long been surpassed by HSV. After a long break the stadium was finally renovated. Between 1951 and 1953 the stadium was rebuilt. On 12 July the stadium was opened as Volksparkstadion (The People`s Park Stadium), named after its location at Altona Volkspark (People`s Park). Most of the building materials came from the ruins of Eimsb\xfcttel, a district of Hamburg destroyed under Allied bombing. The new stadium could hold up to 75,000 and continued to be used for the various sporting events of the city. In 1963, when HSV qualified for the newly created Bundesliga, they moved into the Volksparkstadion, a stadium that was both larger and more modern than Rothenbaum. At this time, FC Altona missed out on the opportunity and has struggled ever since. HSV then began to see some success in the Bundesliga and managed to maintain their status for years to come. HSV won titles in 1979, 1982 and 1983. The stadium is a UEFA Elite stadium which makes it eligible it to host UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League finals. A large clock was added to the northwest corner in 2001 to commemorate HSV`s status as the only club to have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation. The clock marks the time, down to the second, since the league was founded on 24 August 1963. However, after Hamburg`s relegation to the 2nd tier, it has been updated to reflect HSV`s foundation. In 2001 AOL bought the naming rights to the Volksparkstadion for \u20ac15.3 million, retitling the ground as the AOL Arena. In March 2007 the HSH Nordbank bought the naming rights for \u20ac25 million, and the stadium was rebranded as the `HSH Nordbank Arena` in a six-year deal. From July 2010 the arena was called the Imtech Arena, after Imtech bought the naming rights. After Imtech`s sponsorship ended in June 2015, the stadium reverted to its original name of Volksparkstadion. Due to UEFA regulations, when the stadium had a sponsored name it was referred to as the Hamburg Arena for European matches.",img_src:"https://aviewfrommyseat.co.uk/photos/anonymous-20151226104940.jpg",profile_img:"https://www.cunard.com/content/dam/cunard/inventory-assets/ports/HAM/HAM.jpg.image.0.0.low.jpg",url:"Volksparkstadion"},{name:"The City Ground",description:"The City Ground is a football stadium in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Trent. It has been home to Nottingham Forest Football Club since 1898, and has 30,445 seats. The stadium was a venue when England hosted Euro 96, and is only three hundred yards away from Meadow Lane, home of Forest`s neighbouring club Notts County; the two grounds are the closest professional football stadiums in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. They are located on opposite sides of the River Trent. Nottingham Forest moved to their new ground on 3 September 1898 \u2013 33 years after their formation and six years after election to the Football League. To raise the \xa33,000 required to finance the move the club asked members, supporters and businessmen to subscribe to `New Ground Scheme` bearer bonds which cost \xa35 each. Over \xa32,000 was raised this way. The new ground was called the City Ground. It was only a few hundred yards from the old Town Ground at the opposite end of Trent Bridge, which had been named after the Town Arms pub. Nottingham was granted its Charter as a City in 1897 and it was called the City Ground to commemorate this as the land on which it stands was at that time within the City boundary. In 1952 boundary changes resulted in the ground coming under the local council of West Bridgford rather than the City. Opposite the City Ground, still within the City boundaries, lies Meadow Lane, home of Notts County. The City Ground was wide open on three sides with no protection from the weather but the pitch was one of the finest in the country. This was due to the presence on the committee of J. W. Bardill, a nurseryman whose family firm still exists in Stapleford near Nottingham and whose company was given the task of preparing the pitch. In 1935, the club had the opportunity to buy the ground from Nottingham Corporation for \xa37,000 but they declined. On 12 October 1957, a new East Stand opened at the City Ground costing \xa340,000 and having benches to sit up to 2,500 fans. The visitors for the opening were Manchester United\u2019s `Busby Babes`, just four months before eight of them died in the Munich air disaster. A new record attendance of 49,946 was set in October 1967 when Forest beat Manchester Utd 3-1 in a First Division fixture, five months after Forest had finished second to United in the league. On 11 September 1961, the floodlights at the ground were officially turned on for the first time as Forest faced Gillingham in the League Cup. The Main Stand was largely rebuilt in 1965 but on 24 August 1968 fire broke out during a First Division game against Leeds United. The stand was damaged by fire but thankfully, despite a crowd of 31,126, there were no injuries among the crowd. The fire started in the boiler room, just before half-time. The only reported injuries was to the television crew on the TV gantry who had to climb down from the gantry as the ladder was stored in the boiler house and the ladder was the only way up or down, the gantry was extended the length of the stand and now has access at both ends. As a result, Forest played six `home` matches at nearby Meadow Lane and did not win one of them. Sadly many of the club`s records, trophies, memorabilia etc. were lost in the fire. The stand was refurbished. In December 1967 the City Ground was host to an England U23 match against Italy.",img_src:"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/b0/b0/0db0b0a386a09f62d83839f39b7d19bd.jpg",profile_img:"https://thelawyer.imgix.net/content/uploads/2018/12/07164833/iStock-532163450.jpg",url:"The-City-Ground"}],F=function(e){return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"main-content"},i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement(m.b,{className:"back",to:"/cccs"},"BACK")),i.a.createElement("h2",null,e.id),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"ccc-profile-image",style:{backgroundImage:"url("+e.image+")"}}),i.a.createElement("h2",null,e.name),i.a.createElement("p",null,e.details)))},S=function(e){var a=k.map(function(e){return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"Ccc-container"},i.a.createElement(m.b,{to:"/cccs/".concat(e.url)},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"ccc-image",style:{backgroundImage:"url("+e.img_src+")"}})),i.a.createElement("h3",null,e.name))});return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"main-content"},i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement(m.b,{className:"back",to:"/"},"BACK")),i.a.createElement("h2",null,e.title),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"container"},a))},L=function(e){var a=k.map(function(e,a){return i.a.createElement(c.a,{key:a,path:"/cccs/".concat(e.url),render:function(){return i.a.createElement(F,{name:e.name,image:e.profile_img,details:e.description})}})});return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/cccs",render:function(){return i.a.createElement(S,{title:"Cities and Stadia"})}}),a)},P=function(e){function a(){return Object(s.a)(this,a),Object(h.a)(this,Object(d.a)(a).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(u.a)(a,e),Object(l.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){return i.a.createElement(m.a,null,i.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},i.a.createElement(p,null),i.a.createElement(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",render:function(){return i.a.createElement(g,{title:"Premier League 2019: Top Players"})}}),i.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/aaas/",render:function(){return i.a.createElement(y,{title:"United Kingdom"})}}),i.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/bbbs/",render:function(){return i.a.createElement(E,{title:"European Union"})}}),i.a.createElement(c.a,{path:"/cccs/",render:function(){return i.a.createElement(L,{title:"Cities and Stadia"})}})))}}]),a}(n.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(i.a.createElement(P,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[22,1,2]]]);
